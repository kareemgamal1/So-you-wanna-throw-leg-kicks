# So you wanna throw leg kicks
## First project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/revisiting-rock-paper-scissors) curriculum. 
A variation of the classic rock paper and scissors game, Blocking kicks can be pretty tricky but it's absolutely do-able, if you threw a head kick and your opponent tried to defend their legs, then a good head concussion is destined, so will a good body kick if he tried to defend his head, and of course, defending his body leaves his legs vulnerable.  

Please note that this is based on real fights, these guys put their life on the line for our entertainment and I mean no offense at all by using their fighting footage as part of this basic game.
